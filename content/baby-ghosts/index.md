#bio
**kaitlyn dougon** (they/them) is a queer white
settler artist based in Tkaronto/Toronto. They earned
their degree in radio and TV broadcasting but found
their way into video game production with the goal of
developing alongside other indie devs while also
redefining our relationship to value, capital and
community in ways that can generate stability and
sustainability. A lot of their time is dedicated to
thinking about world-building, story crafting, process
and structure, world and art history and classism, but
you'll typically find them creating 3D models that bring
their worlds to life.

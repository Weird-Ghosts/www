**We're looking for the story and vision of your studio.** This is a little different from your typical VC or publisher pitch deck, which usually focuses on a specific project with deeper market analysis and projections. Our programs are focused on _studio development_ so your pitch should reflect that.

At a minimum, please provide:

- Information on your team (names, roles and responsibilities)
- Organizational structure
- Studio culture and values
- Growth goals/studio 5-year vision
- A summary of your [impact goals](/blog/a-brief-intro-to-making-your-indie-game-studio-impactful/)
- A summary of the project(s) you're working on
- Your business and marketing plans, on a very high level
- Studio budget overview

B.P. Solarpunk Media is a Toronto-based studio, led by Kai Little-White, creating immersive experiences — linear and digital — for kids and their caregivers that are filled with heart, impact, and giggles. We use storytelling and immersive media (XR, games, spatial audio, branching narratives, and role play) to entertain, engage, and inspire young participants to positively influence the future. Grounded in research-supported best practices in child development, equity, and education, we partner on experiences that use the power of play and creation to spark curiosity and innovation that open pathways of discovery, wellness, and community stewardship. We dream of a solarpunk future.

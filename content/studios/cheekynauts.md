Cheekynauts Entertainment is an eco-friendly studio founded in Saskatchewan by Samantha Ramsay. Their mission is to create lighthearted, artistically driven games that value diversity and eco-friendly living. The team includes a mix of neurodiverse and queer talents who want to contribute to a more conscientious industry that represents these demographics and empowers their participation with accommodating practices. Our dream is to immerse players in engaging worlds of kindness and inclusion that portray what we all have in common, how embracing and working with our differences can benefit everyone, and the incredible things we can accomplish when we all work together.

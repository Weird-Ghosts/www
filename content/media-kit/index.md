### About Weird Ghosts

Weird Ghosts is an **impact fund** for video game studios led by **underrepresented founders** across Canada.

We support studios with **grants, investments, education, and community** to build strong, impactful teams that are shaping the future of games. We focus on studio development – not just project funding.

- Our [Baby Ghosts](/baby-ghosts) program provides a $25,000 no-strings-attached grant, and six months of tailored, structured business development education via our mentor network and partners.
- Our [SEAL investments](/blog/how-we-make-investments) support new studios with $150,000 to pay salaries and focus on studio development for one year.

To date, we have supported [12 studios](/studios) across 5 provinces through grants and investments.

### Impact

[“The Baby Ghosts program not only gave my studio financial security for this year, it also gave me access to an **inspiring and inclusive community** of peers, collaborators and mentors."<br />- Sam Ramsay, Cheekynauts Entertainment]{.bg-white.block.p-6}

["Receiving the Baby Ghosts grant and being connected with the Weird Ghosts community was **a dream come true**. I was granted the resources and opportunity to take my project STREET UNI X to the next level through some months of full-time development focus after years of only working on the project in my off time between day jobs.”<br />- daffodil, daffodil & friends]{.bg-white.block.p-6}

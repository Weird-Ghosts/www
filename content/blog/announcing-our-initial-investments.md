TORONTO – Impact fund Weird Ghosts is announcing their first round of investments in Canadian studios led by underrepresented founders.

Each of the four studios represents a new model for developing sustainable, worker-centric companies and moves Weird Ghosts closer to its ultimate goal of making studio funding more accessible to marginalized founders in indie games. These creators are developing games and experiences across a wide variety of genres and platforms, from psychological side-scroller _Psychroma_ (Rocket Adrift) to the stylish character action of _Duskwitch_ (VIVIDBLUE Ltd).

In addition to funding, teams receive studio development services including dedicated project and studio development facilitation, storytelling and marketing assistance, pitch prep, hands-on creative and technical support, and an engaged community of support through a partnership with Gamma Space.

“We’re interested in meeting studios where they are at and offering them the support they need to thrive on their own with as few barriers as possible,” said Weird Ghosts co-founder and general partner Eileen Mary Holowka. “Improving the Canadian indie game community involves figuring out how to build sustainability, accessibility, and impact into every aspect of our studios. The sooner studios can start thinking about these questions, the better, and that’s why Weird Ghosts is invested in studio–not just project–funding.”

### [Rocket Adrift](https://rocketadrift.com/)

Toronto-based team Rocket Adrift is founded by Lindsay Rollins, Sloane Smith, and Titus McNally and is Weird Ghosts’ first official early-stage investment. They are a narrative-driven game studio interested in highlighting the perspectives of LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC experiences. Their previous games include Raptor Boyfriend (2021) and Order a Pizza (2019) and they are currently working on Psychroma, a side-scrolling psychological horror game about facing your trauma and finding hope for the future. Rocket Adrift also runs a cyberpunk roleplaying podcast called “Dark Future Dice” and have a devlog where they write about game development, funding, and more.

> "We created Rocket Adrift as a vehicle for our storytelling skills and creative vision. We felt there was no better way to challenge ourselves and create our own opportunities than through collaboration. However, we struggled to gain exposure and opportunities in the industry until we met Weird Ghosts and Gamma Space. Now, we are really excited to share our projects and creative vision with underserved gamers of all walks of life!"

Opportunities like this are pretty rare, so we feel grateful and lucky to have this support.”

Flying Carpets is a Montreal-based independent video game studio founded by Salim Larochelle in 2012. Flying Carpets' mission is to make the games that they want to play, with unique and original designs that can inspire players. Their work is founded on passion, love, and gratification. The studio strongly believes that art is the key to change the world. Through art, creators send messages, give new viewpoints, and bring the audience to a new understanding of what could otherwise be misunderstood. Flying Carpets is now working on the single-player survival horror game Hiboka.

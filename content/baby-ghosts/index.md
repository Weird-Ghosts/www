    - What's our studio structure?\n
    - How do we prioritize tasks?\n
    - What's our business model?\n
    - Who is our audience, and how do we reach them?\n

    question: "What are the expectations for participation?"
    answer: "You'll need to post updates in your Studio and Project Slack channels at least once a week. This is where our mentors really step up. Whether it's time management, prepping for a big meeting, or just vibing with your latest track, we're here for it. The more you share, the more we can help you grow. No question is too small, and no problem is too big. It takes practice to re-learn how to be part of a community and let yourself accept help."

    question: "What outcomes can I expect?"
    answer: "It's crucial that you come to this program prioritizing studio development and not just the game you‚Äôre creating. Here's what studio development might look like for you:\n

    - A relevant deliverable for your project and process, such as a prototype, pitch deck, business model or other plan\n
    - A clearer idea of your studio, your values, and the next steps toward sustainable, regenerative success\n
    - New competencies and perspectives that make tackling pain points more effective and rewarding\n
    - Fast-track pitch readiness for future investment from Weird Ghosts and further integration into the Gamma Space community"

### Am I Ready to Apply?

[The Baby Ghosts Peer Accelerator program is a time to _slow down and consider_ the future of your studio _before_ you start chasing funding opportunities. That may sound counterintuitive, but we help you to accelerate _your value to you_ from the inside out so that others don't accelerate _your value to them_ from the outside in.]{.mt-10.block}

Being able to take advantage of your time in the program is the most important thing, but this can be a deep journey with other considerations. After checking out the FAQs we have, here are some questions to ask yourself (and your team) if you‚Äôre thinking of applying:

- Am I ready to really think about my studio‚Äôs development as seriously as the project my studio is developing?
- Do I have the time and focus to commit to the schedules and activities listed above?
- Am I comfortable with having difficult conversations around goals and values with my team and facilitators?
- Do I have a support system in place of friends, family, or colleagues that have my back if team alignment drifts?
- Can I communicate learning style preferences and access needs comfortably in English?

**About Weird Ghosts**

Weird Ghosts is a social impact fund for underrepresented video game studio founders in Canada. The fund offers two main opportunities: The Baby Ghosts fund, which provides a $25,000 grant along with a 6-month peer accelerator focused on studio development, and the Early fund, which offers up to $150,000 also for studio development.

**Our Values**

Weird Ghosts' goal is to improve diversity and equity in the Canadian games funding ecosystem, supporting a shift away from overworking, fostering a sustainable gaming community in Canada, and promoting projects by and about marginalized people. We believe in non-extractive impact funding, ensuring that our investees cover their costs and pay themselves before we recoup, and that our deals are flexible and benefit our teams more than us.

**Our Impact**

We have supported a variety of studios across Canada, including Rocket Adrift, daffodil & friends, Lucid Tales, Cheekynauts Entertainment, Apocablyss, B.P. Solarpunk Media, Digital Cauldron Collective, Flying Carpets Games, Orion Digital Innovations and Creations Inc., Something Magic, Something We Love, and VIVIDBLUE LTD. These studios span a diverse and creative range of genres and styles.

**How to Apply**

Studios interested in applying for funding through Weird Ghosts must be based in Canada, with a majority of founders from an underrepresented identity group. Applications are evaluated on a rolling basis, and the application process is designed to be transparent and accessible. [Learn more about our process.](blog/how-to-apply-to-weird-ghosts)

**Baby Ghosts Program**

The Baby Ghosts Peer Accelerator is a partnership between Weird Ghosts and Gamma Space. It provides a grant of $25,000 and six months of tailored mentorship. The program emphasizes open communication, progress mapping, and interactive creative reflection. It's a time to slow down and consider the future of your studio before you start chasing funding opportunities.

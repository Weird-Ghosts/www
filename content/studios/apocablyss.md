Apocablyss is a new creative studio based in Montreal and Lunenberg founded by Paloma Dawkins and Ashley Opheim dedicated to creating magical, interactive and multi-platform entertainment that inspires human connection and conscious engagement. Founded on feminist principles, Apocablyss bends towards exploring surrealism, psychedelic, altered states of consciousness and surrealism within fun, colourful, good-vibe environments. They specialize in creating meditative and transformative environments IRL as well as in VR/AR, print and video game formats. Apocablyss is devoted to using new media to explore new forms of storytelling, invoking conversations around caring for our planet and protecting life, creating animated and programmed speculative fictions that help us re-connect and re-imagine ourselves and the world around us in these troubled and turbulent times.

This is a broadly inclusive term meant to prioritize those who have been socially and structurally excluded from accessing capital, professional networks, studio employment or career progression; who have faced barriers to participating in entrepreneurship and government funding programs.

It includes anyone who experiences marginalization or underrepresentation due to their gender (including people who are at any intersection of trans and nonbinary identities, however they are or are not expressed), race and/or skin colour (e.g., <abbr title="Indigenous, Black, and People of Colour">IBPoC</abbr> individuals), queerness, disability, religion, housing status, economic status, immigration or citizenship status (including newcomers to Canada).

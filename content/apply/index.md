Apply to Weird Ghosts.
::

::two-col-body

#col1
[Just two important things before you apply:]{.text-2xl.block.mb-6}

1. **Make sure you're eligible.** Your studio must be based in Canada, and a majority of founders from an underrepresented identity group.
2. **Familiarize yourself** with our mandate of social impact, and supporting studio development rather than single projects.

#col2
Applications for the Baby Ghosts program will open **September 1**. Join our mailing list to be notified when applications open and to receive the link to the info session!

Applications for Early funding are currently closed. Please [get in touch](mailto:hello@weirdghosts.ca){.underline .font-bold} if you have any questions or would like to be notified when they open. Applications for our [Baby Ghosts program](/baby-ghosts) will open soon across Canada.

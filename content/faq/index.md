  question: "What are pain points?"
  answer: "We chat with Peer Accelerator team members about the challenges and concerns they're facing in their studios. These are what we call \"pain points.\" Every studio is unique, but here are some questions that often come up:\n

  - What's our studio structure?\n
  - How do we prioritize tasks?\n
  - What's our business model?\n
  - Who is our audience, and how do we reach them?\n
  - How do we scope our demo within our resources?"

#### What funding opportunities does Weird Ghosts offer and what's the application process like?

We offer two main funding opportunities: The Baby Ghosts fund provides a $25,000 grant along with a 6-month peer accelerator focused on studio development. Our Early fund offers up to $150,000 mainly for studio development. We aim to finalize funding deals within two months of application submission and respond to all submissions within two weeks.

#### What's the eligibility criteria for funding?

Your studio must be based in Canada, and a majority (half or more) of founders must be from an underrepresented identity group. We have no preference for the stage of development or genre of your games. Teams without a shipped game can apply, but we generally don’t fund solo developers unless you have a plan to grow beyond just yourself. Unfortunately, international studios or teams outside Canada cannot apply at this time.

#### What is an “underrepresented identity group”?

This is a broadly inclusive term meant to prioritize those who have been socially and structurally excluded from accessing capital, professional networks, studio employment or career progression; who have faced barriers to participating in entrepreneurship and government funding programs.

It includes anyone who experiences marginalization or underrepresentation due to their gender (including people who are at any intersection of trans and nonbinary identities, however they are or are not expressed), race and/or skin colour (e.g., IBPoC individuals), queerness, disability, religion, housing status, economic status, immigration or citizenship status (including newcomers to Canada).

#### What is “studio development”?

We mean any activities related to:

- **Structure, ownership and management:** Forming a co-op; setting expectations between founders; legal aspects of working with contractors, employees and partners.
- **Business models:** Establishing revenue channels through services, product development, IP, partnerships, multi-channel strategies and monetization
- **Goals and values:** Centering studio work around shared guiding principles
- **Process and operating methodologies:** Project management tools and methods, roles and responsibilities, development of transparent and effective communication strategies

#### Can solo developers or teams without prior game development experience apply for funding?

Teams without a shipped game are welcome to apply, although we are looking for founders with the skills and experience to manage a project. We generally do not fund solo developers, but if you have a solid vision for growing your studio beyond yourself, let’s talk!

#### What is a non-extractive impact fund?

Impact investments are investments that are made to generate measurable social or cultural impacts alongside financial returns. For Weird Ghosts, some of our impact goals are to improve the diversity and equity in the Canadian games funding ecosystem, support a shift away from overworking in games, support a sustainable gaming community in Canada, and see more projects by and about marginalized people. “Non-extractive” means that we will make sure our investees pay themselves and cover their costs before we recoup, and that our deals are flexible and benefit our investees more than us.

Our fund intends to make not only financial returns, but also measurable social impact returns through our own work and the outcomes of the work of our studio investees. Read more about what that means in our article, [“A brief intro to making your indie game studio impactful”](https://weirdghosts.ca/blog/a-brief-intro-to-making-your-indie-game-studio-impactful/). We are also designing deals that prioritize the sustainability of our investees.

#### What should I include in my pitch deck?

**We’re looking for the story and vision of your studio.** This is a little different from your typical VC or publisher pitch deck, which usually focuses on a specific project with deeper market analysis and projections. Our programs are focused on *studio development* so your pitch should reflect that.

At a minimum, please provide:

- Information on your team (names, roles and responsibilities)
- Organizational structure
- Studio culture and values
- Growth goals/studio 5-year vision
- A summary of your [impact goals](https://weirdghosts.ca/blog/a-brief-intro-to-making-your-indie-game-studio-impactful/)
- A summary of the project(s) you’re working on
- Your business and marketing plans, on a very high level
- Studio budget overview

#### Is funding available on a rolling basis?

Yes, funding is awarded on a rolling basis. We close our application form a few times a year while our programs are underway, typically from June-November.

#### Where does the funding for Weird Ghosts come from?

The resources for this project are donated by Infinite Ammo Inc. One of our co-founders is the sister of Infinite Ammo’s late founder, Alec. This project has been backed by support from his family. We want to be transparent about the fact that Weird Ghosts exists because of really painful circumstances that also hurt members of our community. It is our hope that Weird Ghosts transforms this pain into something positive for our community.

No other investors or LPs are involved in the fund at this time.

#### How do I apply for funding through Weird Ghosts?

First, ensure you are eligible. We are funding video game studios (no tabletop at this time, so sorry!) in Canada led by marginalized founders. Next, complete our [application form](https://weirdghosts.ca/apply).

If you have any questions, we’d be happy to answer them via [email](mailto:hello@weirdghosts.ca).

#### What accountability is expected from funded studios?

We require quarterly financial statements and encourage regular check-ins with our team.

#### Are there any specific geographical areas within Canada that are prioritized for funding?

No, but we would love to see more applications from the Prairies, Territories, and Atlantic Canada!

#### Can the funds be used for hiring external contractors?

Yes, investment funds can be used as you see fit, as long as it supports the studio development.

#### How does Weird Ghosts support studios beyond financial assistance?

Yes, this is actually critical to what defines Weird Ghosts. We know that financial assistance has limitations without further resources such as community support, targeted business mentorship, and connections to resources. Applying to Weird Ghosts isn’t about applying to fund your dream game (although making our dream game is important to us!). It’s about receiving the opportunity to develop a sustainable studio, feeling connected and secure in a video game community, and work on your dream game project in a healthy and manageable way.

#### I’m still unsure of whether I qualify or how to apply.

If you have read our FAQ and [How to Apply](https://weirdghosts.ca/blog/how-to-apply-to-weird-ghosts/) blog post and are still confused, don’t hesitate to reach out by [email](mailto:hello@weirdghosts.ca).

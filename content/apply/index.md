[Just two important things before you apply:]{.text-2xl.block.mb-6}

1. **Make sure you&#8217;re eligible.** Your studio must be based in Canada, and a majority of founders from an underrepresented identity group.
2. **Prep your pitch deck.** We're looking for an [overview of your studio](/faq#what-should-i-include-in-my-pitch-deck), not just a project.

#col2

daffodil & friends is a Vancouver-based studio comprised of daffodil, a unicycle-stunting non-binary game developer and multi-disciplinary artist, as well as all of their friends who are, have been, and will be helping to build games together alongside daffodil. daffodil & friends aims to build the games that their interests and directions of care uniquely suit them to make. daffodil & friends are currently working towards creating an upcoming PS1 styled extreme unicycling game, STREET UNI X, which holistically leverages and engages with daffodil's real-life passions for the worlds of extreme sports, unicycling, and the capital X eXtreme era of classic action sports video games.

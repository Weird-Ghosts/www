slug: "resources"
order: 6

The resources for this project are donated by Infinite Ammo Inc. One of our co-founders is the sister of Infinite Ammoâ€™s late founder, Alec. This project has been backed by support from his family.
We want to be transparent about the fact that Weird Ghosts exists because of really painful circumstances that also hurt members of our community. It is our hope that Weird Ghosts transforms this pain into something positive for our community.

No other investors or LPs are involved in the fund at this time.

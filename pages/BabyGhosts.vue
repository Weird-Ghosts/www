                  The Baby Ghosts program is a time to slow down and consider
                  the future of your studio before you start chasing funding
                  opportunities. That doesn’t mean we exclude people who are
                  working on pitches or involved in other programs, but we do
                  require our investees to have the time available for weekly
                  updates, regular meetings, and the willingness to focus on
                  studio development—not just project development.

                  The teams who get the most out of the Baby Ghosts program are
                  ready and excited to have tough conversations as a studio
                  about their goals and values, working relationships, and where
                  their weaknesses are. We encourage applicants to think about
                  their outside supports before applying. Who do you have in
                  your support network to turn to if something goes wrong with
                  your studio during the program (such as a team member leaving
                  or a change in your studio vision)? We do our best to practice
                  trauma-informed, wellness-oriented care towards our investees;
                  but it's important that you have strong emotional and social
                  resources beyond the program.

                  We are able to accommodate many different learning styles,
                  access needs, and forms of communicating. In order to best
                  meet each studio where we’re at, we expect you to be as
                  upfront as possible about your needs so that we can prepare
                  the space for you. (For example, do you prefer written
                  communication to video meetings? Do you need visual
                  interaction during meetings in order to focus?) Unfortunately
                  we only operate in spoken and written English right now, but
                  we hope to expand this in the future.

                        arts space advocate based in Tkaronto/Toronto. He has
                        been working for over 25 years to facilitate more
                        equitable and inclusive relationships between artists,
                        technology, and processes. Henry co-founded Gamma Space
                        as a not-for-profit coworking space for indie game
                        makers in 2012. The pandemic found him rethinking how
                        communities care for and work together, and since 2020
                        he has been helping transform Gamma Space into a co-op
                        that actively engages with its values.

    question: "What funding opportunities does Weird Ghosts offer and what's the application process like?"
    answer: "Our SEAL funding offers up to $150,000 for studio development. We aim to finalize funding deals within two months of application submission and respond to all submissions within two weeks. Our application form is open on a rolling basis, but closes a few times a year while our programs are underway.\n\nWe previously offered the Baby Ghosts program, but it is now administered through [our nonprofit](https://babyghosts.fund/grant-and-accelerator)."

    question: "What's the eligibility criteria for funding?"
    answer: "Your studio must be based in Canada, and a majority (half or more) of founders must be from an underrepresented identity group. We have no preference for the stage of development or genre of your games. Teams without a shipped game can apply, but we generally don’t fund solo developers unless you have a plan to grow beyond just yourself. Unfortunately, international studios or teams outside Canada cannot apply at this time."

    question: "What is an “underrepresented identity group”?"
    answer: "This is a broadly inclusive term meant to prioritize those who have been socially and structurally excluded from accessing capital, professional networks, studio employment or career progression; who have faced barriers to participating in entrepreneurship and government funding programs.\n\nIt includes anyone who experiences marginalization or underrepresentation due to their gender (including people who are at any intersection of trans and nonbinary identities, however they are or are not expressed), race and/or skin colour (e.g., IBPoC individuals), queerness, disability, religion, housing status, economic status, immigration or citizenship status (including newcomers to Canada)."

    question: "What is a non-extractive impact fund?"
    answer: "Impact investments are investments that are made to generate measurable social or cultural impacts alongside financial returns. For Weird Ghosts, some of our impact goals are to improve the diversity and equity in the Canadian games funding ecosystem, support a shift away from overworking in games, support a sustainable gaming community in Canada, and see more projects by and about marginalized people. “Non-extractive” means that we will make sure our investees pay themselves and cover their costs before we recoup, and that our deals are flexible and benefit our investees more than us.\n\nOur fund intends to make not only financial returns, but also measurable social impact returns through our own work and the outcomes of the work of our studio investees. Read more about what that means in our article, [“A brief intro to making your indie game studio impactful”](https://weirdghosts.ca/blog/a-brief-intro-to-making-your-indie-game-studio-impactful/). We are also designing deals that prioritize the sustainability of our investees."

    question: "Where does the funding for Weird Ghosts come from?"
    answer: "Currently, our investor Infinite Ammo Inc. contributes 100% of our budget. One of our co-founders is the sister of Infinite Ammo’s late founder, Alec. This project has been backed by support from his family. We want to be transparent about the fact that Weird Ghosts exists because of really painful circumstances that also hurt members of our community. It is our hope that Weird Ghosts transforms this pain into something positive for our community.\n\nNo other investors or LPs are involved in the fund at this time."

    question: "How do I apply for funding through Weird Ghosts?"

It is available during certain periods of the year (sign up for our mailing list to be notified when it is open).\n\nIf you have any questions, we’d be happy to answer them via [email](mailto:hello@weirdghosts.ca)."

    question: "How does Weird Ghosts support studios beyond financial assistance?"
    answer: "Yes, this is actually critical to what defines Weird Ghosts. We know that financial assistance has limitations without further resources such as community support, targeted business mentorship, and connections to resources. Applying to Weird Ghosts isn’t about applying to fund your dream game (although making our dream game is important to us!). It’s about receiving the opportunity to develop a sustainable studio, feeling connected and secure in a video game community, and work on your dream game project in a healthy and manageable way."

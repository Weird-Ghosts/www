### [Identifying Pain Points]{.text-2xl.leading-10.font-extrabold}

Baby Ghosts consult with Weird Ghosts and Gamma Space team
members about the challenges, gaps, stresses and concerns
inside their studio. We refer to these as
_pain points_.

No two studios are the same, but here are some common
questions they bring:

- What's our studio structure?
- How do we prioritize tasks?
- What is our business model?
- Who is our audience, and how do we reach them?
- How do we scope our demo within our resources?

### [Mentorship and hands-on support]{.text-2xl.mt-8.leading-10.font-extrabold}

Program facilitators listen and engage with Baby Ghost
participants to provide processes, information, tools and
expertise within the mentorship team and/or from the broader
Gamma Space community.

Here are some examples of how facilitators and community
members can help:

**Team Dev**: studio roles, recruitment, collaboration
and communication

**Project Management**: tasks, scheduling and planning

**Story Dev for Studio and Project**: pitching,
fundraising

**Workflow Dev**: tech and creative, asset management,
accessibility integration

**Publicity Planning**: audiences, online presentation
and campaigns

**Solidarity Strategies**: unlearning implicit biases;
integrating implicit solidarities, integrating supports for
neurodifferences

We're invested in setting you up for success in every possible
way. From experience, we've found that the more a studio
engages with facilitators and the Gamma Space community, the
better the outcome. The more we get to know and work with you,
the more we can answer questions, provide high-level support,
and help fill production gaps.

### Expectations

While a Baby Ghost, you'll be posting activity updates in your
Studio and Project Slack channels at least once a week. For
example:

> We're stressed out because we've had to crunch recently. We need to figure out what steps to take to avoid this next time!
> Our latest company pitch deck will be revised before next week's funder meeting.
> Feeling pretty good about this song I composed for our trailer! Check it out! Send your feedback!

This is where Gamma Space mentors rally! We can meet or
discuss in-channel strategies to better manage time,
communication and deadlines. Or we can review materials ahead
of an important meeting. Sometimes we will just tell
you how much we like your jams.

Remember: We need your support to support you. The more you
participate, share and contribute in your channels, the more
you learn how to explain and share your needs, and the more
effectively we can help you progress!

When you practice narrating your process, saying everything
out loud, you realize _no question is too small; no problem is too overwhelming_.

We know that talking about yourself and your process can be
hard because many of us are trained from an early age to be
independent. It takes practice to (re)learn how to be in
community and let yourself accept help. That's part of
what this program aims to achieve.

### Timeline

Here's how your time as a Baby Ghost breaks down:

### Month 1

- Onboarding with Gamma Space peer mentors
  Monday Night Check-in presentation (10-15 min + Q&A during 1.5-hour meeting)
- Detailed pain points discussion resulting in strategies to
  address them.

### Months 2-3

- Workin' hard on your studio's development
- Weekly written check-ins in your studio Slack channel
- 1-4 meetings per month to provide supports you request

Getting involved in the Gamma community (if you want!)

### Month 4

- Summarizing your progress
- Planning next steps!
- Exit Interview

### Outcomes

It's crucial that Baby Ghosts' outcomes reflect their studio
development, and not just the game they're working on, so the
particulars of this will vary from team to team:

- A relevant deliverable for your project and process, such as
  a prototype, pitch deck, business model or other plan
- A clearer idea of your studio, your values, and the next steps
  towards sustainable, regenerative success
- New competencies and perspectives that make tackling pain
  points more effective and rewarding
- Fast-track pitch readiness for future investment from Weird
  Ghosts &amp; further integration into the Gamma Space
  community

### Am I Ready to Apply?

The Baby Ghosts program is a time to slow down and consider
the future of your studio before you start chasing funding
opportunities. That doesn't mean we exclude people who are
working on pitches or involved in other programs, but we do
require our investees to have the time available for weekly
updates, regular meetings, and the willingness to focus on
studio developmentâ€”not just project development.

The teams who get the most out of the Baby Ghosts program are
ready and excited to have tough conversations as a studio
about their goals and values, working relationships, and where
their weaknesses are. We encourage applicants to think about
their outside supports before applying. Who do you have in
your support network to turn to if something goes wrong with
your studio during the program (such as a team member leaving
or a change in your studio vision)? We do our best to practice
trauma-informed, wellness-oriented care towards our investees;
but it would be best if you had strong emotional and social
resources beyond the program.

We can accommodate many learning styles,
access needs, and communication forms. To best
meet each studio where we're at, we expect you to be as
upfront as possible about your needs so that we can prepare
the space for you. (For example, do you prefer written
communication to video meetings? Do you need visual
interaction during meetings to focus?) Unfortunately,
we only operate in spoken and written English, but
we hope to expand this.

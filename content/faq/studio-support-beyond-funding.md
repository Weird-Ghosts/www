Yes, this is actually critical to what defines Weird Ghosts. We know that financial assistance has limitations without further resources such as community support, targeted business mentorship, and connections to resources. Applying to Weird Ghosts isnâ€™t about applying to fund your dream game (although making our dream game is important to us!). It's about receiving the opportunity to develop a sustainable studio, feeling connected and secure in a video game community, and work on your dream game project in a healthy and manageable way.

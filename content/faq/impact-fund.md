Impact investments are investments that are made to generate measurable social or cultural impacts alongside financial returns. For Weird Ghosts, some of our impact goals are to improve the diversity and equity in the Canadian games funding ecosystem, support a shift away from overworking in games, support a sustainable gaming community in Canada, and see more projects by and about marginalized people. “Non-extractive” means that we will make sure our investees pay themselves and cover their costs before we recoup, and that our deals are flexible and benefit our investees more than us.

Our fund intends to make not only financial returns, but also measurable social impact returns through our own work and the outcomes of the work of our studio investees. Read more about what that means in our article, ["A brief intro to making your indie game studio impactful"](/blog/a-brief-intro-to-making-your-indie-game-studio-impactful/). We are also designing deals that prioritize the sustainability of our investees.
